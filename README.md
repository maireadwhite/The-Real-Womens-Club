### Credits and Acknowledgement
CI Love running project has been used to guide the structure of this site. 
Decided to go with flexbox as a layout as it is cleaner and fits better with the site: https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrLFMe7f4NisDcArFYM34lQ;_ylu=Y29sbwNpcjIEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1652813884/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fcss-tricks.com%2fsnippets%2fcss%2fa-guide-to-flexbox%2f/RK=2/RS=1EYTvPaiiiiwPIUs07Owb8lGUjc-
Used Unsplash to download a few images.

### Testing UX goals
- 
1. Tested websites responsiveness via [Bytes](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103965781/170603189-b91f5ddf-9bfc-4990-8b5e-3d429ff5cd39.png)
2. Switched image text and main flexbox text to make it quicker for a first time user to understand sites goal. 
3. Class tab is in clear nav bar at top and opens directly. No other info on page to distract. But clear statement that only registered members will get acces to timetable of events.

Social media links accessible on the footer of every page making it easier for visitors to search more information. 
Layout remains the same  acrosss the three pages.


## Deployment

Deployed on github. 

### Github pages
The project was deployed to Github pages via the following steps:
1. Access github repositories 
2. Select The Real Womens Club
3. Settings 
4. Pages / main / Save

## what works well
Table turned out well and so did form. I dont think I was fully ready to use flex box and had to learn along the way. 

## What I would of like to have added 
Better images, Video etc. Keep having issues with size and animation. Had to take the animation out in the end. 

## Issues encountered(Bug found and squashed)
17/05/22 having issue with flex box layout. Layout going across screen and not downways. I have compared code with Flexbox tutorial on Youtube and not seeing any difference. I will keep looking but if not I might try a work around. Getting the place settings to go in right spot seems to be a difficulty I have through all projects so far ie love running. I am determined to find out why.

Fixed positions by moving Div to around asides and article. Tutorial had it around the whole body. Going by tutorial my layout was wrong and would not place correctly. Have manages to position menu tags inline by wrapping them. 
17/05/22 Navigation set up but somehow lost my menu color
18/5/22 unable to move submit botton to center/bottom. 
README file was openening in browser as I had changed the name of the index file to home.html, so i have changed it back agian. 
23/05/22 I could not get social media icons to show on footer. Realised I had downloaded version 5, but using version 6 icons 
26/055/22 When all changes were made to clean site image from main page is not showing on deployed site.

I have tried the pathways but they dont seem to be the issue. 


## Things I tried out. 
Tried differnet font sizes for menu tabs at the begining. Have decided to leave at 100% until more work is done to site. 
Decided to go with flexbox as a layout, seems much cleaner layout and seems to fit the style im after. 
Tried different colors to complement each other. 
Tried lots of pics to try fill main page.
